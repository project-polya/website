George Pólya (/ˈpoʊljə/; Hungarian: Pólya György [ˈpoːjɒ ˈɟørɟ]) (December 13, 1887 – July 9th, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician. He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at ETH Zürich and from 1940 to 1953 at Stanford University. He made fundamental contributions to combinatorics, number theory, numerical analysis and probability theory. He is also noted for his work in heuristics and mathematics education. He has been described as one of The Martians. (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya))

This project is named after him to show our respect and the love for research and learning in the field of Mathematics and its related subject, Computer Science. 

Moreover, the grading process is somehow related to counting. Polya's research has brought contributions to combinatorics. We hope that our project can also bring ease to the users.
