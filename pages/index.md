**Welcome to Project Polya**

## Introduction
Project Polya is a group of repositories designed to bring ease and joy for the project grading of CSE
students, focusing on friendliness, safety and efficiency.

**Why not use online judges directly?** Very often, students's projects cannot be automatically checked 
by those existing OJs. Teachers may also list UX, GUI, robustness and report as the grading criteria
and manual grading is required.
